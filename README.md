## UX and UI Design

- The planning of this project was kept inline with the five planes of user-centric design. This is to ensure a clean-looking website that is fully responsive. I wanted to quiz that was based on imagery rather than words. This ensures a keen minimalist design, which will be powerful to play on all devices.

- I initially sketched my design using pen and paper. As well as a to-do list of potential features I wanted to implement. When I was happy with my final sketched design, I created my design using the Balsamiq Wireframes program as a solid template for the futures of the website.

## Design

### Imagery

- Imagery was sourced from the stock image website, Unsplash. All flag images were sourced from Flagpedia. Both of which are linked below in the content section.

- Images, if required, were compressed using TinyPNG in order to improve website accessibility.

- I link sleek and minimal design. Which I have implemented into this website. Minimal text, and images fuel the process of this website.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Background Image

<summary>Background Image</summary>

</details>


- I felt like this background image was amazing for this project. It gives a nice warm friendly feeling. Almost like a cosy Autumn. The magnifying glass searching for countries is a great addition to the whole concept of the quiz.

---

#### Logo / Heading

<details>
<summary>Logo</summary>

![Logo Image](assets/images/readme-logoimage.png)

</details>

- The logo is a nice and simple design. It is the name of the quiz within two Font Awesome flag icons, of a flag. I felt like this simple design does not distract the user from the quiz at all. but also clearly defines the quiz in itself.

#### Generate Flag Button

<details>
<summary>Generate Flag Button</summary>

![Generate Flag Button](assets/images/readme-generateflagbtn.png)

</details>

- The generate flag button is a simple button but with the font of the the website. This is to maintain the same style throughout the website. This button will display a new flag for the user to guess. 

---

#### Flag Question

<details>
<summary>Flag Question</summary>

![Flag Question](assets/images/readme-theflagquestion.png)

</details>

- The 'whose flag is this' remains consistent through the quiz. It is using the same font family to continue the theme. The flag is generated after the user clicks the 'generate random flag' button. The flag image remains the biggest image on the page, as this is what the user needs to see in order to answer the question.

- The flag is taken from flagpedia.net.

---

#### Option Buttons

<details>
<summary>Answer Options</summary>

The option buttons use the same font as the whole webpage, which is keeping in with the websites theme.
