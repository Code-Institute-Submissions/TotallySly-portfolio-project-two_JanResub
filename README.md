## UX and UI Design

- The planning of this project was kept inline with the five planes of user-centric design. This is to ensure a clean-looking website that is fully responsive. I wanted to quiz that was based on imagery rather than words. This ensures a keen minimalist design, which will be powerful to play on all devices.

- I initially sketched my design using pen and paper. As well as a to-do list of potential features I wanted to implement. When I was happy with my final sketched design, I created my design using the Balsamiq Wireframes program as a solid template for the futures of the website.

- I enjoyed the Love Maths project with the Code Institute, so I adopted and adapted their quiz layout.

## Design

### Imagery

- Imagery was sourced from the stock image website, Unsplash. All flag images were sourced from Flagpedia. Both of which are linked below in the content section.

- Images, if required, were compressed using TinyPNG in order to improve website accessibility.

- I link sleek and minimal design. Which I have implemented into this website. Minimal text, and images fuel the process of this website.

## Testing

### Validator Testing

### Manual Testing

Responsive testing was conducted on a Windows Laptop, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 plus, and a Samsung Galaxy Tab A8. As these devices are limited to their screen sizes. I also tested the responsiveness using Google Dev Tools and [Responsive PX](http://www.responsivepx.com/).

Testing was conducted on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari web browsers.

After website completion, I submitted the website to Code Institute's Slack Community, specifically the 'Peer-Code-Review' channel.
